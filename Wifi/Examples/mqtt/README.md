## Example

An example is provided to show how to manage the communications with the AQS-X01. 

The example has been developed using Arduino IDE and common libraries for the ESP8266.

There lots of examples and resources online.

Maqiatto and Mosquitto in Raspberrypi have been used as a MQTT broker and Node Red and some Android MQTT applications as client to test the correct behaviour.
